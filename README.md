1. We started by looking at everything the game required for functionality and broke it down into different chuncks and made an empty method for each chunck. We then worked on one method at a time and built out the functionality for that specific method.
2. If we had one more day to work on the project, we would have worked on parts of iteration four.
3. We used driver/navigator as well as one person sharing their screen and both discussing how to write the code/solve problems.
4. Feedback was shared mostly through huddles or through messages on slack.
